For the less faithful, there&rsquo;s always wizardry, the price of which is only to study (and study, and study). Hell, even the fighter has seized power - all you need is a weapon and the courage to use it.</p>\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t enough. Surprise, surprise. And so, you&rsquo;ve come to me, asking for just a little bit more. Warlock, they&rsquo;ll call you. Betrayer, pact-maker. I just want to warn you that it won&rsquo;t necessarily be pretty.</p>\n<p>And, of course, there&rsquo;s a price.

The Warlock has final say on their patron and their patron&rsquo;s traits at character creation, but afterwards the GM assumes the patron as one of their characters.</li>\n<li>For the GM - it might be useful to think of the Warlock&rsquo;s Patron as being their own Front (or representing their own unique danger or presence in any other way you prefer). In my personal experience, it&rsquo;s often been easier to rely on GM moves like Show signs of an approaching threat or Reveal an unwelcome truth when I think about the Patron&nbsp; but I think the story benefits if those moves follow through on a large scale.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Oblation<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The boon can be anything the GM sees fit - a magical item, a follower, an additional temporary spell, etc. The Warlock can ask for a specific boon, or perhaps even Parley if they have leverage and a reliable way of communicating with their Patron.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The Dark Art Of The Deal<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The bond created with this move works like any other bond - it counts for Aid/Interfere, and it can be resolved and then erased for XP. If one of the bonds is erased, for any reason, the rest of the move (taking +1 forward for pursuing the goal, taking damage for breaking their word) no longer triggers. If either party breaks their word, that might be grounds for resolving the bond.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Empowered Patronage<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The Warlock may of course refuse the deal if the terms are not to their liking. If the deal is refused, the spell is not empowered.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Eyes And Ears Of The Rune-Keeper<br />\n<ul>\n<li>This move does let the Warlock understand any written or spoken language, but it must in fact be a language. Mad ramblings, animal barks or calls, and other language-approaching words or sounds probably don&rsquo;t count.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Non-Euclidian Casting<br />\n<ul>\n<li>While the Warlock is not in their right mind, the GM and Warlock should both confer about how that character acts, but the GM has final say.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Warlock Spells<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Gaseous Form<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The Warlock can transform themselves with this spell. They retain the agency to end the spell at any time, even while they&rsquo;re a gas.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Acid Rain<br />\n<ul>\n<li>This spell might not require clouds to already be above when the spell takes place, but casting the spell inside might be tricky.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Chain Lightning<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The damage roll happens once.
