When they want to make something alchemical happen, this is the move they should roll, with one exception - if it&rsquo;s an attack/throwing a vial, it&rsquo;s probably a Volley (unless the target is close enough to easily hit), and their attack gains the appropriate tags. Rolling+INT is meant to signal creativity/planning/intention in a way beyond &ldquo;I throw to hit them&rdquo;. For that reason, it&rsquo;s possible to do some weird things - does an electrochemical healing experiment zap people to heal them? Does an endothermic plant grow icicles or does it grow a big snowman? All of these results are acceptable to me, but the GM gets final say. Importantly, nearly each kind of experiment is d angerous.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Gather Reagents<br />\n<ul>\n<li>This move guarantees that the Alchemist will get reagents when they go out looking, without a roll. It does not protect them from the dangers of being in a place where alchemical materials can be found - those dangers might still need to be defied, for example.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Homebrewing&nbsp;\n<ul>\n<li>If the Alchemist wants to do something not covered by In The Mix, they can always turn to homebrewing. This move mimics the Wizard&rsquo;s Ritual, and can do just about anything (as long as the conditions are met).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Polyjuice Potion, Roguelike, and Hops, Barley, and Everything Gnarly\n<ul>\n<li>These moves have fairly straightforward effects on their own, but also add complexity and options to In The Mix - again, what a poisonous combustion experiment does is open to interpretation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Mixomancer and Chemistry Wizard<br />\n<ul>\n<li>These moves make individual spells replicable with In The Mix, but always require special material components to use - something more than just standard alchemical reagents.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Biovisionary<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Like all ritual-like effects, this requires a little more input from the player, and exactly how to bottle life essence to create life in the lab is something the GM will need to provide input on.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Potionblood<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Picking up this move means that the Alchemist can exude liquids now! It&rsquo;s just a thing they can do. It might be through their palms, or maybe their spit or even their blood. There&rsquo;s some fuzziness as to whether the bonus and penalty are part of the effects of the alchemical substance (and thus transferrable) or unique to the Alchemist&rsquo;s particular biochemistry. This particular implementation is left up to the conversation between the Alchemist and the GM. Two reminders - First, that GM characters don&rsquo;t have stats, so any effect there will be up to the GM&rsquo;s discretion. Second, that other Powered by the Apocalypse games often cap the final modifier to a roll at +4, since beyond that it is impossible to roll a 6-.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>","races":{"0":{"label":"Human","description":"When you l ook for rare reagents in a new land, ask the GM what rare materials can be found here.

To summarize, when an eidolon is summoned, it&rsquo;s treated as a character, it can spend hold to make a special move related to its nature and its plane, and it has a drive that determines how it acts.</li>\n<li>On a 10+, the eidolon has two hold, +2 to one stat of the summoner&rsquo;s choice, +0 to every other stat, and the Summoner chooses the eidolon&rsquo;s drive.</li>\n<li>On a 7-9, the eidolon has one hold, +1 to one stat of the summoner&rsquo;s choice, -1 to one stat of the GM&rsquo;s choice, +0 to every other stat, and the GM chooses the eidolon&rsquo;s drive.</li>\n<li>On a 6-, an eidolon is still summoned, has one hold, and the GM can make a move. That move might include changing what stats the eidolon has or anything else about the eidolon, or the GM can choose to make any of their other moves.</li>\n<li>The eidolon does not disappear when it runs out of hold, but only when it runs out of HP.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Mundane Conjuration<br />\n<ul>\n<li>This allows the Summoner to summon objects from the material plane. Anything inanimate, nonmagical, and not too large is fair game, but this move won&rsquo;t take pieces of an object - the Summoner can&rsquo;t tunnel through rock, for example, by summoning pieces of earth out one at a time.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Let&rsquo;s Make a Deal<br />\n<ul>\n<li>This move doesn&rsquo;t require that the powerful entity is summoned via Come Forth!, although that&rsquo;s certainly an option, especially if the entity has ties to the Summoner&rsquo;s tethered plane.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Secondary School and Master&rsquo;s Degree<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Secondary School and Master&rsquo;s Degree both change the way the Summoner&rsquo;s effective Wizard level is determined. Secondary School first sets the Summoner&rsquo;s effective Wizard level to be equal to their Summoner level divided in half, and rounded up. Master&rsquo;s degree sets the Summoner&rsquo;s effective Wizard level to be one less than their Summoner level. Ex: at level 7, a Summoner with Secondary School has an effective Wizard level of 4, but a level 7 Summoner with Master&rsquo;s Degree has an effective Wizard level of 6.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>9-1-1<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The entity summoned this way is not necessarily treated as a character the Summoner controls (although it might or might not be a familiar eidolon). How it behaves and what moves it has access to is entirely up to the GM, but success on the Defy Danger roll does still imply that the threat does not come to bear (against the Summoner).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>","races":{"0":{"label":"Elf","description":"Your people run deep with the magic of the forests.

If the Paragon wants a strange virtue, that&rsquo;s fine, but the GM might ask to hear more about their culture. This move has two triggers: one is for helping (or interfering with) other people, and grants an additional die for the Aid/Interfere roll. The other is for taking action on your own, embodying the chosen virtue, and grants 1 Virtue, a special kind of hold. It&rsquo;s possible that they don&rsquo;t both trigger if you&rsquo;re aiding or interfering</li>\n<li>Other player characters can absolutely tell the Paragon how they were inspired by the Paragon&rsquo;s actions. This won&rsquo;t grant the Paragon 1 Virtue unless they&rsquo;re telling the truth, though.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Stand for Something<br />\n<ul>\n<li>This move does not guarantee that other people will share your opinion of your virtue, and it does not depend on their recognition of that virtue as a virtue at all. Another way of thinking about it is that for the Paragon, their virtue is always leverage for Parley, except that there&rsquo;s explicitly room for the GM character to disagree about what that virtue is or means or if it even matters at all.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Battlefield Leader<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The intention of these moves is to let the Paragon help make several things happen simultaneously, and change narrative positioning to make those things possible. This move can&rsquo;t supersede the fiction, however - if the Paragon commands an ally to reposition, but that ally is stuck in a way that words or advice can&rsquo;t help, this move can&rsquo;t make that happen. Although the Paragon can &ldquo;command&rdquo; player characters to do things, players have final say of course on if their character follows through. The Paragon can also command Hirelings with this move.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Battlefield Master<br />\n<ul>\n<li>This move will tell you which side, at a glance, is going to win the battle and who (on both sides) will die (or live). There are of course fates worse or at least different than death, but to get more specific information, you might need to Discern Realities.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For The Honor<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The heroic form doesn&rsquo;t necessarily end automatically when all the relevant hold is spent. It&rsquo;s up to the Paragon and GM to determine how long this transformation lasts. The new heroic truth could be dramatic and universal, such as &ldquo;Law without compassion is cruel&rdquo; or it could be situational (&ldquo;the people here would join you if you offer them safety&rdquo;) - but it&rsquo;s always heroic.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We Have The Power<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Although the bonds written for this move might lend themselves particularly well to heroic forms and boons, the Paragon can choose any ally and any bond to inspire their form.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There Are Always Trumpets<br />\n<ul>\n<li>To be clear, the horns of battle can be metaphorical, if the GM approves. Some kind of prop is likely necessary, but waving a battle standard or playing a flamethrower guitar could conceivably suffice.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>","races":{"0":{"label":"Human","description":"You’re a people person.

The GM and player should discuss how many bonds the Turncloak can have at maximum, both with the enemy and with their allies. It is my official suggestion that at three bonds with the enemy, the Turncloak is in so deep as to be repulsive to essentially everyone.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Relevant Experience<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Just like when you take a starting move through a multiclass move, you get all the related moves/the moves that make that move work. The chosen move introduces complications&nbsp; can everyone who works for the enemy do this? Could only the Turncloak, making them especially visible and their return highly sought?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Underhanded<br />\n<ul>\n<li>One hand free means it can&rsquo;t be holding a shield, weapon, or anything else. The d irty tag refers to unfair, surprising tactics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Scoundrel Background<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Each Turncloak background imitates loosely some other moves that can be widely applicable. The Scoundrel&rsquo;s specifically is meant to accomplish something similar to the Thief&rsquo;s Trap Expert/Tools of the Trade, but the Turncloak will have to say what item they are sacrificing to disarm the trap. It&rsquo;s a little less proactive, but can work almost like a specific Defy Danger and can trigger whenever the Scoundrel activates a trap, even by accident.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Beastmaster<br />\n<ul>\n<li>In addition to the regular features of a monster (like its tags, damage, instincts, and moves) the beast should have a loyalty score if it ever needs to be ordered around. It feels thematically appropriate that even the beast could turn on the Turncloak, but if it&rsquo;s ever gone for good, the Turncloak should have the option of getting a new pet or exchanging this move.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Nemesis System<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Since Dungeon World doesn&rsquo;t have a Harm move like many other PbtA games, the Last Breath move can color just how bad it gets for the Turncloak, but having this move means that lasting death is probably off the table (think &ldquo;He&rsquo;s only mostly dead&rdquo; a la Princess Bride). If the Turncloak is felled by a foe but the other PCs remain, this move gives the Turncloak the power to decide if that foe escapes automatically. Lastly, &ldquo;your enemy&rdquo; is an expansive category - as long as the person that leaves the Turncloak for dead is aligned in some way with the Turncloak&rsquo;s enemy faction, this move could trigger.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Decisionist<br />\n<ul>\n<li>This wordy move represents the Turncloak making a meaningful turn one way or the other. On the one side is the new life they&rsquo;ve been making, represented by the bonds with their allies. On the other is the life they left behind, represented by the bonds with the enemy. This move triggers when the Turncloak finally picks, once and for all, even/especially symbolically which means more to them. The partial success (7-9) suggests that it isn&rsquo;t easy, or at least costs the Turncloak something. The full success means that the Turncloak might have left one life behind, but continues to carry that life experience, for now anyway.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","races":{"0":{"label":"Returned","description":"Your former masters brought you back from the dead.

Pretty much everything dies, although there are some exceptions. You&rsquo;d like to be one of those, but let&rsquo;s not get ahead of ourselves.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s another truth: Death is useful. Most people don&rsquo;t think about that one, but it&rsquo;s on your mind pretty much daily. So the rest of the world can&rsquo;t appreciate just a little extra utility. So having an undead labor force would &ldquo;destabilize the free market&rdquo; and &ldquo;totally gross everyone out&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>You don&rsquo;t get to mastery of the necromantic art without stepping on and probably looking at a few severed toes.</p>\n<p>Much better to be out here, in the thick of it, raising the dead and plaguing the living who dare to get in your way. You&rsquo;ve seen the look your companions give you, that fear mixed with disgust and if we&rsquo;re being honest probably a little awe.</p>\n<p>Who can blame them?

The GM sets the limits on how many undead can be controlled at once. The primary inspiration for this move comes from Apocalypse World, in which gangs don&rsquo;t roll to deal harm. Citing rules for when several monsters deal damage, the damage the horde deals to a single target is equal to the number of undead attacking that target, but it might be appropriate for the horde to do more or less damage at the GM&rsquo;s discretion.</li>\n<li>Here&rsquo;s a stylistic choice for the Necromancer and GM to discuss - how hard is it to kill a zombie (or other undead in the horde)? My suggestion would be to think of it outside of &ldquo;damage&rdquo; - the horde doesn&rsquo;t have HP, after all. In fact, it&rsquo;s probably useful for the GM to think about &ldquo;killing&rdquo; members of the horde as an extension of the GM move U se up their resources.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Command<br />\n<ul>\n<li>If the Necromancer wants the horde to do something that&rsquo;s not covered by this list of options, it&rsquo;s up to the GM if the horde does it at all.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Spellbook of the Dead<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Starting as a Wizard level one means that the Necromancer learns three first level spells when they take this move.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Consume Soul<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Exactly how many undead are destroyed is up to the GM.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Good Help is Hard to Find<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Exactly what working together means is up to interpretation, but if you have only one undead working for you, it probably can&rsquo;t happen.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ghost Buster<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The armor piercing only applies to armor that represents the intangibility of the spirit or other related creature. If the spirit has other armor for whatever reason, perhaps a poltergeist is inhabiting a suit of armor, or a spirit is encased in stone, the GM might decide that some of that armor is not pierced.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Blood Ritual<br />\n<ul>\n<li>In effect, the sacrifice becomes an additional requirement that the GM imposes for the Ritual. The GM has final say on what kind of sacrifice will suffice.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>To Hell and Back<br />\n<ul>\n<li>What circumstances actually permit the Necromancer to travel to the Black Gates is left as a conversation between the GM and the players.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","races":{"0":{"label":"Human","description":"Death is l ike any problem - it’s meant to be solved.

The answer will be dependent on the fiction, but often I don&rsquo;t think that Defy Danger could trigger under these circumstances either - the attack happening is often part of the resolution of Hack &amp; Slash. Put another way, by choosing to Hack &amp; Slash, a Monk is typically not using an enemy&rsquo;s attack against them, but instead acting on the offensive.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Lethal Weapon<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Notice that this does not make the Monk&rsquo;s body a weapon for Hack &amp; Slash purposes - it is up to the GM if an unarmed monk can trigger Hack &amp; Slash in the moment.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The Way of Steel<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Conversely to Lethal Weapon, using Martial Art can make your weapon more effective for Hack &amp; Slash.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Closed Fist and Open Palm<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Once you have taken one of these moves, you can not take the other.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Return Fire<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Just as Martial Art doesn&rsquo;t automatically trigger when the Monk defies the danger of a melee attack, so too for Return Fire. In order to deal damage with Return Fire, the Monk must be able to throw or shoot the ranged shot back.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Deeply Spiritual<br />\n<ul>\n<li>This move allows the Monk to talk to animals from their native land, and also gives a specific condition (spend time in meditative contemplation) to learn how to speak to additional animals.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Nature&rsquo;s Pupil<br />\n<ul>\n<li>This opens up animal moves, such as the Druid has access to when Shapeshifted (e.g. trample them, escape to the air, drag them to the ground, etc).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Journey to the West<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Although a possible outcome is that the traveler you meet on the way would want to become your hireling, it is not guaranteed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Revolutionary Praxis<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Debate is a common, but certainly not the exclusive, way to test philosophies.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>One With Nothing<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Like other moves that use bonds as resources, the intention here is that there is some maximum number of bonds (set by the GM and player) and that erasing that bond for the purpose of this move indicates that you have one fewer bond for the rest of time.

However, this isn&rsquo;t the Volley move. This move intentionally doesn&rsquo;t direct the player to &ldquo;deal their damage&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s a likely outcome, but the GM decides if it makes sense in the moment.

Swords hold a lot of symbolic weight, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be a sword.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Sword Magic<br />\n<ul>\n<li>This move is intended to work both in a reactive capacity (e.g., when the GM describes what is happening, the Spellblade can say &ldquo;Aha! I spend one hold to do -&rdquo;) but it can also be used purely proactively (e.g. when this move triggers, the Spellblade uses their hold to immediately produce an effect). This move requires more narrative justification than Hack &amp; Slash however, and many things can cause the Spellblade to lose hold prematurely (including making any other move or perhaps the result of someone making a move against the Spellblade). In addition, the Spellblade explicitly can&rsquo;t choose two options at once - as soon as the Spellblade spends hold to make a choice, the spotlight shifts to someone else. This move is based heavily off of the move Neutralize from Fraser Simon&rsquo;s excellent game The Veil.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Make History\n<ul>\n<li>The Spellblade has final say about what kind of events this move will trigger for, but often the trigger requires other people (or events that other people are responsible for).</li>\n<li>For the first option, if any allies choose that they&rsquo;d like someone&rsquo;s attention, they can choose whose they&rsquo;d like, even if their choice is different than the Spellblade&rsquo;s.</li>\n<li>For the last option, the Spellblade declares the nature of the connection and who or what it&rsquo;s between, and the other players (including the GM) decide who would know more. Players are allowed to select their own character.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Stormbringer<br />\n<ul>\n<li>GM&rsquo;s discretion, but think of the Barbarian&rsquo;s move Smash! and how much freedom that gives the player.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The Hero Of This Story<br />\n<ul>\n<li>On a 7-9, &ldquo;held responsible&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean that the Spellblade is believed to have perpetrated everything, but that they are personally accountable, through their action or inaction, for what is going on.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","races":{"0":{"label":"Good","description":"Give up personal wealth or power for the greater good."},"1":{"label":"Neutral","description":"Defeat a powerful personal foe."},"2":{"label":"Evil","description":"Choose glory, fame, or power over compassion."},"3":{"label":"???","description":""}},"alignments":{"0":{"label":"Human","description":"Tales of your legend are already beginning to spread.

This move asserts two specific qualities that affect the strength of rune magic - the medium for the writing and the means of inscription. My intuition is that quickly written or smaller runes, such as in ink, are less powerful, and that runes inscribed in harder, more magical material are stronger and last longer, but this is a suggestion only.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Interjection<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Aid or Interfere will still only trigger when appropriate - if the Runepriest&rsquo;s advice or other words aren&rsquo;t appropriate to aid (or interfere), then the move doesn&rsquo;t happen.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Fire and Brimstone<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The Runepriest must provide the GM with the precept/belief to which they are appealing.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>95 Theses<br />\n<ul>\n<li>In order for the move to trigger, the note does have to get back to its target somehow - but of course, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be the same note. The pope doesn&rsquo;t need to read the very letter you nail to the door, but can read someone&rsquo;s report about it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ghostwriter<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The phrase &ldquo;arcane materials&rdquo; is included here mostly with the intention to ask the player to describe how they are writing something metaphysically but also to color how many words of power one soul can hold/whether a soul can hold more than one or even one word of power without being destroyed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The Wise Man&rsquo;s Fear<br />\n<ul>\n<li>You can&rsquo;t say someone&rsquo;s true name that you don&rsquo;t know.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Hear My Voice<br />\n<ul>\n<li>In addition to the added complications of speaking words this way, the effect of Words of Power still depends upon the medium and means of inscription, which is to say that air counts as the medium and material, for the purposes of determining the effect. Again, the effects are left up to conversation between GM and player.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Future Tense<br />\n<ul>\n<li>When working with triggered runes, it&rsquo;s up to the GM&rsquo;s preference as to whether the roll for Words of Power happens when the rune is scribed or when it&rsquo;s activated. However, describing the intended effect (and thus, whether the rune has a delayed trigger or not) always happens b efore the roll.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The Rest is Silence<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The new rune is likely in some way related to the deceased&rsquo;s powers and deeds in life.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Spells</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Doom<br />\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp;As written, this does nothing for GM characters and messes with the Barbarian&rsquo;s Herculean Appetites. For the first fix, the GM can interpret what fictional effect the spell might have that empowers a GM character against another character. For the Barbarian, if Herculean Appetites triggers, their player can choose to roll a third die, either a d6 or d8, but their final total must include a d6 and a d8.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Shibboleth<br />\n<ul>\n<li>This spell supersedes Tongue and Mouth of the Rune Keeper.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Celestial Bolt<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Found wanting by the Divine, that is. This can include the Runepriest. Especially devout or divinely beloved creatures might take no damage from this spell.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Summon Angel<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The extraplanar creature is summoned believing the Runepriest to be worthy - the Runepriest&rsquo;s actions or words might convince the creature otherwise.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>","races":{"0":{"label":"Dwarf","description":"Stonework is a major part of your studies.

Slaying a particularly nasty hydra, for example.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The First Avenger<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Specifically, this means that when the Olympian throws their shield in an ally&rsquo;s defense, they can select; to redirect an attack from the thing they defend to themselves; to halve the attack&rsquo;s effect or damage; to open up the attacker to an ally giving that ally +1 forward against the attacker; or to deal damage to the attacker equal to the Olympian&rsquo;s level. If the Olympian has any moves that add further options, they can instead choose to do one of those also. The Olympian can do this in lieu of Defending any other way - this isn&rsquo;t rolling to Defend and then selecting an additional option. Importantly, the two halves of this move don&rsquo;t mix - the Olympian doesn&rsquo;t Volley their shield to Defend, so it can&rsquo;t come back to them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Romance Epic<br />\n<ul>\n<li>This move doesn&rsquo;t force characters to fall in love with the Olympian. Consent can&rsquo;t be overruled, even by divine mandate.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Zero to Hero<br />\n<ul>\n<li>In order to obtain the option selected, the onus is on the Olympian to describe how their training makes that selection possible.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The Man, The Myth, The Legend<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The 10+ result implies a positive effect. Even if, in the long run, the Olympian regrets their labor or it had disastrous consequences, in the instance that triggered the 10+ result, the community has benefited from that labor.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","races":{"0":{"label":"Human","description":"Your god has guided your l ife since you were born, and i f you reach out for advice you often find yourself pushed i n the right direction.
