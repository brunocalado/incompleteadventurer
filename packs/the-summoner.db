To summarize, when an eidolon is summoned, it&rsquo;s treated as a character, it can spend hold to make a special move related to its nature and its plane, and it has a drive that determines how it acts.</li>\n<li>On a 10+, the eidolon has two hold, +2 to one stat of the summoner&rsquo;s choice, +0 to every other stat, and the Summoner chooses the eidolon&rsquo;s drive.</li>\n<li>On a 7-9, the eidolon has one hold, +1 to one stat of the summoner&rsquo;s choice, -1 to one stat of the GM&rsquo;s choice, +0 to every other stat, and the GM chooses the eidolon&rsquo;s drive.</li>\n<li>On a 6-, an eidolon is still summoned, has one hold, and the GM can make a move. That move might include changing what stats the eidolon has or anything else about the eidolon, or the GM can choose to make any of their other moves.</li>\n<li>The eidolon does not disappear when it runs out of hold, but only when it runs out of HP.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Mundane Conjuration<br />\n<ul>\n<li>This allows the Summoner to summon objects from the material plane. Anything inanimate, nonmagical, and not too large is fair game, but this move won&rsquo;t take pieces of an object - the Summoner can&rsquo;t tunnel through rock, for example, by summoning pieces of earth out one at a time.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Let&rsquo;s Make a Deal<br />\n<ul>\n<li>This move doesn&rsquo;t require that the powerful entity is summoned via Come Forth!, although that&rsquo;s certainly an option, especially if the entity has ties to the Summoner&rsquo;s tethered plane.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Secondary School and Master&rsquo;s Degree<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Secondary School and Master&rsquo;s Degree both change the way the Summoner&rsquo;s effective Wizard level is determined. Secondary School first sets the Summoner&rsquo;s effective Wizard level to be equal to their Summoner level divided in half, and rounded up. Master&rsquo;s degree sets the Summoner&rsquo;s effective Wizard level to be one less than their Summoner level. Ex: at level 7, a Summoner with Secondary School has an effective Wizard level of 4, but a level 7 Summoner with Master&rsquo;s Degree has an effective Wizard level of 6.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>9-1-1<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The entity summoned this way is not necessarily treated as a character the Summoner controls (although it might or might not be a familiar eidolon). How it behaves and what moves it has access to is entirely up to the GM, but success on the Defy Danger roll does still imply that the threat does not come to bear (against the Summoner).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>","races":{"0":{"label":"Elf","description":"Your people run deep with the magic of the forests.
