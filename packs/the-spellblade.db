A young hero, full of promise, wields the magical blade and slays the dragon. Sound familiar? What they don&rsquo;t tell you is how much work it is. Spare a thought for all these people who just don&rsquo;t get it. It&rsquo;s not that while they were all at the tavern you were studying the blade. It&rsquo;s not just that you wanted it more. It&rsquo;s that you stay awake at night, running over the forms in your head. It&rsquo;s that you learned how to summon forth magical power and then thought to yourself &ldquo;what if I did this with a sword, too&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s that when your arms were too sore from training, you took out some metamagical treatises and read as much as you could.</p>\n<p>So yeah, you could say you&rsquo;re a little driven. But that&rsquo;s the way it goes - the winners write the history books, and you&rsquo;ve always wanted to be an author.

Swords hold a lot of symbolic weight, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be a sword.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Sword Magic<br />\n<ul>\n<li>This move is intended to work both in a reactive capacity (e.g., when the GM describes what is happening, the Spellblade can say &ldquo;Aha! I spend one hold to do -&rdquo;) but it can also be used purely proactively (e.g. when this move triggers, the Spellblade uses their hold to immediately produce an effect). This move requires more narrative justification than Hack &amp; Slash however, and many things can cause the Spellblade to lose hold prematurely (including making any other move or perhaps the result of someone making a move against the Spellblade). In addition, the Spellblade explicitly can&rsquo;t choose two options at once - as soon as the Spellblade spends hold to make a choice, the spotlight shifts to someone else. This move is based heavily off of the move Neutralize from Fraser Simon&rsquo;s excellent game The Veil.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Make History\n<ul>\n<li>The Spellblade has final say about what kind of events this move will trigger for, but often the trigger requires other people (or events that other people are responsible for).</li>\n<li>For the first option, if any allies choose that they&rsquo;d like someone&rsquo;s attention, they can choose whose they&rsquo;d like, even if their choice is different than the Spellblade&rsquo;s.</li>\n<li>For the last option, the Spellblade declares the nature of the connection and who or what it&rsquo;s between, and the other players (including the GM) decide who would know more. Players are allowed to select their own character.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Stormbringer<br />\n<ul>\n<li>GM&rsquo;s discretion, but think of the Barbarian&rsquo;s move Smash! and how much freedom that gives the player.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The Hero Of This Story<br />\n<ul>\n<li>On a 7-9, &ldquo;held responsible&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean that the Spellblade is believed to have perpetrated everything, but that they are personally accountable, through their action or inaction, for what is going on.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","races":{"0":{"label":"Good","description":"Give up personal wealth or power for the greater good."},"1":{"label":"Neutral","description":"Defeat a powerful personal foe."},"2":{"label":"Evil","description":"Choose glory, fame, or power over compassion."},"3":{"label":"???","description":""}},"alignments":{"0":{"label":"Human","description":"Tales of your legend are already beginning to spread.
