Everyone&rsquo;s heard the myths, right? Someone storms the heavens, steals fire, a new weapon of unfathomable power, and the world will never be the same. A few people laugh, a few people cry.</p>\n<p>Most are silent. But perhaps one person among them realizes exactly what it is that is happening.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s enough fancy philosophizing. In the real world, some people are going to die. Some people are going to live. You hold the difference in your hands.</p>\n<p>Except, maybe it doesn&rsquo;t feel so much like a difference, just something dangerous. Hope you&rsquo;re feeling lucky.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Name: Millie, John, Annie, Leon, Mathilda, Lirianne, Keanu, Billy, Liberty, Nisha, Angel</li>\n<li>Epithet: Blondie, Deadeye, Pilgrim, Kid, Starbuck, Marshall, Doc, Leaden, Boss, Sundown</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Look</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>BODY: Lithe, Honed, Beaten, or _ ___________</li>\n<li>EYES: Weary, Piercing, Distant, or _ ___________</li>\n<li>HAIR: Dirty and unkempt, Military cut, Fashionable hat, or _ ___________</li>\n<li>CLOTHES: Leather duster, Crisp shirt, Weathered cloak, or _ _______</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Bonds</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>_____________ doesn&rsquo;t have what i t takes to survive out here.

What else do you need?</p>\n<p>Your Gun:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rifle ( +1 damage, near, far, two-handed, reload, 2 weight)</li>\n<li>Blunderbuss (close, near, two-handed, forceful, reload, 2 weight)</li>\n<li>Two Pistols (near , 6 magazine, reload , 1 weight)</li>\n<li>Leather Armor (1 armor, worn, 1 weight)</li>\n<li>Dungeon Rations (5 uses, ration, 1 weight), Uses l eft: 5</li>\n<li>Fistful of Bullets (3 ammo, 0 weight), Ammo l eft: 3</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Choose one:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dagger (hand, 1 weight)</li>\n<li>Two Healing Potions ( 0 weight)</li>\n<li>14 coins</li>\n<li>Antitoxin ( 0 weight) &amp; Halfling Pipeleaf (6 uses, 0 weight) Uses left: 6</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>About The Gunslinger</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Guns, Bullets, R eload, and Ammo\n<ul>\n<li>The tag r eload just means that loading the gun isn&rsquo;t trivial - whereas an arrow can quickly be pulled and then drawn with a bow, the process is more involved with a gun (or, for that matter, anything with the r eload tag). Reloading a gun does not mark off ammo - although selecting to mark off 1 ammo, such as for the 7-9 choice in Volley, might indicate that a gun might need to be reloaded</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>High Noon<br />\n<ul>\n<li>A clock is provided on the second page on which to keep track of the hour. For more discussion on and examples of excellent uses of clocks, please see Apocalypse World and/or Blades in the Dark.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Cool Down<br />\n<ul>\n<li>As the clock grows late, the window is likely closing on the narrative circumstances in which the Gunslinger can trigger this move.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In The Crosshairs<br />\n<ul>\n<li>This does mean on a 10+ that the Gunslinger can just immediately shoot three things in the scene. However, this isn&rsquo;t the Volley move. This move intentionally doesn&rsquo;t direct the player to &ldquo;deal their damage&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s a likely outcome, but the GM decides if it makes sense in the moment. It could, for example, trigger Firearms Proficiency and be shooting someone at the Gunslinger&rsquo;s mercy, or maybe the target dodges out of the way.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Dusty Henry<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Typically, the leverage here would be the threat of violence.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Magic Bullet<br />\n<ul>\n<li>GM gets final say on whether or not a creature&rsquo;s armor would be pierced by armor if it doesn&rsquo;t explicitly appear on the list, but the effect is meant to be widely applicable.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>I Kill With My Heart<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Exactly how many bonds a character can have as their maximum is left for the GM and player to decide. For the purposes of this playbook, I assumed it to be around five. After a bond is erased, if they have any &ldquo;room&rdquo; for bonds left, the Gunslinger can write a new bond with the ally if they would like, but erasing bonds via this move does not grant XP and erasing a bond for this move might also imply a serious change in the Gunslinger&rsquo;s relationship with a person, although players are free to interpret this how they wish.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Akimbo<br />\n<ul>\n<li>With this move, whenever the Gunslinger deals damage, first they roll to see exactly how much damage they are doing and then they choose how to split that up (if they would like to split it up at all). Damage does not have to be divided evenly.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Shot the Sheriff\n<ul>\n<li>This move is intended to work a little bit like the Compendium Class Landed Gentry, although not necessarily with as much baggage - just the narrative impetus that sometimes you&rsquo;ll be needed to protect your settlement.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","races":{"0":{"label":"Lawful","description":"Bring justice and order to those who lack i t."},"1":{"label":"Neutral","description":"Avoid or defuse entanglement or obligation."},"2":{"label":"Chaotic","description":"Fight to free yourself or others from the powerful."},"3":{"label":"???","description":""}},"alignments":{"0":{"label":"Human","description":"You’ve been a little of everywhere, and you don’t tend to stay anywhere long.
