Pretty much everything dies, although there are some exceptions. You&rsquo;d like to be one of those, but let&rsquo;s not get ahead of ourselves.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s another truth: Death is useful. Most people don&rsquo;t think about that one, but it&rsquo;s on your mind pretty much daily. So the rest of the world can&rsquo;t appreciate just a little extra utility. So having an undead labor force would &ldquo;destabilize the free market&rdquo; and &ldquo;totally gross everyone out&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>You don&rsquo;t get to mastery of the necromantic art without stepping on and probably looking at a few severed toes.</p>\n<p>Much better to be out here, in the thick of it, raising the dead and plaguing the living who dare to get in your way. You&rsquo;ve seen the look your companions give you, that fear mixed with disgust and if we&rsquo;re being honest probably a little awe.</p>\n<p>Who can blame them? Life&rsquo;s too short to fight over things like that.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Human: Thu, Eric, Amy, Victor, Anita, Tom, Rhas, Raven, Alex, Rochelle</li>\n<li>Revenant: Strahd, Vecna, Palawa, Khosatral, Limdul, Jarad, Kena, Sylvanas</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Look</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>EYES: Icy, Bloodshot, Empty sockets, or _ ___________</li>\n<li>BODY: Hunched, Shriveled, Fat, or _ ___________</li>\n<li>HAIR: Bone white, Waist-length, Damp, or _ ___________</li>\n<li>ROBES: Tattered, Pristine, Hideous, or _ ___________</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Bonds</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Unfortunately, __________ is much more useful to me alive.</li>\n<li>______________ has a very good body, but, uh, I&rsquo;m not interested.</li>\n<li>Although, if I could get a better look at their muscular structure...</li>\n<li>______________ isn&rsquo;t willing to do what i t takes.

The GM sets the limits on how many undead can be controlled at once. The primary inspiration for this move comes from Apocalypse World, in which gangs don&rsquo;t roll to deal harm. Citing rules for when several monsters deal damage, the damage the horde deals to a single target is equal to the number of undead attacking that target, but it might be appropriate for the horde to do more or less damage at the GM&rsquo;s discretion.</li>\n<li>Here&rsquo;s a stylistic choice for the Necromancer and GM to discuss - how hard is it to kill a zombie (or other undead in the horde)? My suggestion would be to think of it outside of &ldquo;damage&rdquo; - the horde doesn&rsquo;t have HP, after all. In fact, it&rsquo;s probably useful for the GM to think about &ldquo;killing&rdquo; members of the horde as an extension of the GM move U se up their resources.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Command<br />\n<ul>\n<li>If the Necromancer wants the horde to do something that&rsquo;s not covered by this list of options, it&rsquo;s up to the GM if the horde does it at all.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Spellbook of the Dead<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Starting as a Wizard level one means that the Necromancer learns three first level spells when they take this move.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Consume Soul<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Exactly how many undead are destroyed is up to the GM.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Good Help is Hard to Find<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Exactly what working together means is up to interpretation, but if you have only one undead working for you, it probably can&rsquo;t happen.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ghost Buster<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The armor piercing only applies to armor that represents the intangibility of the spirit or other related creature. If the spirit has other armor for whatever reason, perhaps a poltergeist is inhabiting a suit of armor, or a spirit is encased in stone, the GM might decide that some of that armor is not pierced.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Blood Ritual<br />\n<ul>\n<li>In effect, the sacrifice becomes an additional requirement that the GM imposes for the Ritual. The GM has final say on what kind of sacrifice will suffice.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>To Hell and Back<br />\n<ul>\n<li>What circumstances actually permit the Necromancer to travel to the Black Gates is left as a conversation between the GM and the players.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","races":{"0":{"label":"Human","description":"Death is l ike any problem - it’s meant to be solved.
