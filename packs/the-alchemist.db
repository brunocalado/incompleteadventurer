When they want to make something alchemical happen, this is the move they should roll, with one exception - if it&rsquo;s an attack/throwing a vial, it&rsquo;s probably a Volley (unless the target is close enough to easily hit), and their attack gains the appropriate tags. Rolling+INT is meant to signal creativity/planning/intention in a way beyond &ldquo;I throw to hit them&rdquo;. For that reason, it&rsquo;s possible to do some weird things - does an electrochemical healing experiment zap people to heal them? Does an endothermic plant grow icicles or does it grow a big snowman? All of these results are acceptable to me, but the GM gets final say. Importantly, nearly each kind of experiment is d angerous.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Gather Reagents<br />\n<ul>\n<li>This move guarantees that the Alchemist will get reagents when they go out looking, without a roll. It does not protect them from the dangers of being in a place where alchemical materials can be found - those dangers might still need to be defied, for example.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Homebrewing&nbsp;\n<ul>\n<li>If the Alchemist wants to do something not covered by In The Mix, they can always turn to homebrewing. This move mimics the Wizard&rsquo;s Ritual, and can do just about anything (as long as the conditions are met).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Polyjuice Potion, Roguelike, and Hops, Barley, and Everything Gnarly\n<ul>\n<li>These moves have fairly straightforward effects on their own, but also add complexity and options to In The Mix - again, what a poisonous combustion experiment does is open to interpretation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Mixomancer and Chemistry Wizard<br />\n<ul>\n<li>These moves make individual spells replicable with In The Mix, but always require special material components to use - something more than just standard alchemical reagents.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Biovisionary<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Like all ritual-like effects, this requires a little more input from the player, and exactly how to bottle life essence to create life in the lab is something the GM will need to provide input on.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Potionblood<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Picking up this move means that the Alchemist can exude liquids now! It&rsquo;s just a thing they can do. It might be through their palms, or maybe their spit or even their blood. There&rsquo;s some fuzziness as to whether the bonus and penalty are part of the effects of the alchemical substance (and thus transferrable) or unique to the Alchemist&rsquo;s particular biochemistry. This particular implementation is left up to the conversation between the Alchemist and the GM. Two reminders - First, that GM characters don&rsquo;t have stats, so any effect there will be up to the GM&rsquo;s discretion. Second, that other Powered by the Apocalypse games often cap the final modifier to a roll at +4, since beyond that it is impossible to roll a 6-.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>","races":{"0":{"label":"Human","description":"When you l ook for rare reagents in a new land, ask the GM what rare materials can be found here.
