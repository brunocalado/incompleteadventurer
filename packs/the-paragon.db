If the Paragon wants a strange virtue, that&rsquo;s fine, but the GM might ask to hear more about their culture. This move has two triggers: one is for helping (or interfering with) other people, and grants an additional die for the Aid/Interfere roll. The other is for taking action on your own, embodying the chosen virtue, and grants 1 Virtue, a special kind of hold. It&rsquo;s possible that they don&rsquo;t both trigger if you&rsquo;re aiding or interfering</li>\n<li>Other player characters can absolutely tell the Paragon how they were inspired by the Paragon&rsquo;s actions. This won&rsquo;t grant the Paragon 1 Virtue unless they&rsquo;re telling the truth, though.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Stand for Something<br />\n<ul>\n<li>This move does not guarantee that other people will share your opinion of your virtue, and it does not depend on their recognition of that virtue as a virtue at all. Another way of thinking about it is that for the Paragon, their virtue is always leverage for Parley, except that there&rsquo;s explicitly room for the GM character to disagree about what that virtue is or means or if it even matters at all.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Battlefield Leader<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The intention of these moves is to let the Paragon help make several things happen simultaneously, and change narrative positioning to make those things possible. This move can&rsquo;t supersede the fiction, however - if the Paragon commands an ally to reposition, but that ally is stuck in a way that words or advice can&rsquo;t help, this move can&rsquo;t make that happen. Although the Paragon can &ldquo;command&rdquo; player characters to do things, players have final say of course on if their character follows through. The Paragon can also command Hirelings with this move.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Battlefield Master<br />\n<ul>\n<li>This move will tell you which side, at a glance, is going to win the battle and who (on both sides) will die (or live). There are of course fates worse or at least different than death, but to get more specific information, you might need to Discern Realities.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For The Honor<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The heroic form doesn&rsquo;t necessarily end automatically when all the relevant hold is spent. It&rsquo;s up to the Paragon and GM to determine how long this transformation lasts. The new heroic truth could be dramatic and universal, such as &ldquo;Law without compassion is cruel&rdquo; or it could be situational (&ldquo;the people here would join you if you offer them safety&rdquo;) - but it&rsquo;s always heroic.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We Have The Power<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Although the bonds written for this move might lend themselves particularly well to heroic forms and boons, the Paragon can choose any ally and any bond to inspire their form.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>There Are Always Trumpets<br />\n<ul>\n<li>To be clear, the horns of battle can be metaphorical, if the GM approves. Some kind of prop is likely necessary, but waving a battle standard or playing a flamethrower guitar could conceivably suffice.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>","races":{"0":{"label":"Human","description":"You’re a people person.
