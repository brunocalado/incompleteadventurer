Slaying a particularly nasty hydra, for example.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The First Avenger<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Specifically, this means that when the Olympian throws their shield in an ally&rsquo;s defense, they can select; to redirect an attack from the thing they defend to themselves; to halve the attack&rsquo;s effect or damage; to open up the attacker to an ally giving that ally +1 forward against the attacker; or to deal damage to the attacker equal to the Olympian&rsquo;s level. If the Olympian has any moves that add further options, they can instead choose to do one of those also. The Olympian can do this in lieu of Defending any other way - this isn&rsquo;t rolling to Defend and then selecting an additional option. Importantly, the two halves of this move don&rsquo;t mix - the Olympian doesn&rsquo;t Volley their shield to Defend, so it can&rsquo;t come back to them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Romance Epic<br />\n<ul>\n<li>This move doesn&rsquo;t force characters to fall in love with the Olympian. Consent can&rsquo;t be overruled, even by divine mandate.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Zero to Hero<br />\n<ul>\n<li>In order to obtain the option selected, the onus is on the Olympian to describe how their training makes that selection possible.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The Man, The Myth, The Legend<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The 10+ result implies a positive effect. Even if, in the long run, the Olympian regrets their labor or it had disastrous consequences, in the instance that triggered the 10+ result, the community has benefited from that labor.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","races":{"0":{"label":"Human","description":"Your god has guided your l ife since you were born, and i f you reach out for advice you often find yourself pushed i n the right direction.
