There was that time when you did divert that kobold&rsquo;s spear with one-hand and knocked him and all his buddies in the river.

The answer will be dependent on the fiction, but often I don&rsquo;t think that Defy Danger could trigger under these circumstances either - the attack happening is often part of the resolution of Hack &amp; Slash. Put another way, by choosing to Hack &amp; Slash, a Monk is typically not using an enemy&rsquo;s attack against them, but instead acting on the offensive.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Lethal Weapon<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Notice that this does not make the Monk&rsquo;s body a weapon for Hack &amp; Slash purposes - it is up to the GM if an unarmed monk can trigger Hack &amp; Slash in the moment.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The Way of Steel<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Conversely to Lethal Weapon, using Martial Art can make your weapon more effective for Hack &amp; Slash.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Closed Fist and Open Palm<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Once you have taken one of these moves, you can not take the other.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Return Fire<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Just as Martial Art doesn&rsquo;t automatically trigger when the Monk defies the danger of a melee attack, so too for Return Fire. In order to deal damage with Return Fire, the Monk must be able to throw or shoot the ranged shot back.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Deeply Spiritual<br />\n<ul>\n<li>This move allows the Monk to talk to animals from their native land, and also gives a specific condition (spend time in meditative contemplation) to learn how to speak to additional animals.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Nature&rsquo;s Pupil<br />\n<ul>\n<li>This opens up animal moves, such as the Druid has access to when Shapeshifted (e.g. trample them, escape to the air, drag them to the ground, etc).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Journey to the West<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Although a possible outcome is that the traveler you meet on the way would want to become your hireling, it is not guaranteed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Revolutionary Praxis<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Debate is a common, but certainly not the exclusive, way to test philosophies.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>One With Nothing<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Like other moves that use bonds as resources, the intention here is that there is some maximum number of bonds (set by the GM and player) and that erasing that bond for the purpose of this move indicates that you have one fewer bond for the rest of time.
