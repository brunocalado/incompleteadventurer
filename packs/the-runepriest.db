This move asserts two specific qualities that affect the strength of rune magic - the medium for the writing and the means of inscription. My intuition is that quickly written or smaller runes, such as in ink, are less powerful, and that runes inscribed in harder, more magical material are stronger and last longer, but this is a suggestion only.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Interjection<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Aid or Interfere will still only trigger when appropriate - if the Runepriest&rsquo;s advice or other words aren&rsquo;t appropriate to aid (or interfere), then the move doesn&rsquo;t happen.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Fire and Brimstone<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The Runepriest must provide the GM with the precept/belief to which they are appealing.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>95 Theses<br />\n<ul>\n<li>In order for the move to trigger, the note does have to get back to its target somehow - but of course, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be the same note. The pope doesn&rsquo;t need to read the very letter you nail to the door, but can read someone&rsquo;s report about it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ghostwriter<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The phrase &ldquo;arcane materials&rdquo; is included here mostly with the intention to ask the player to describe how they are writing something metaphysically but also to color how many words of power one soul can hold/whether a soul can hold more than one or even one word of power without being destroyed.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The Wise Man&rsquo;s Fear<br />\n<ul>\n<li>You can&rsquo;t say someone&rsquo;s true name that you don&rsquo;t know.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Hear My Voice<br />\n<ul>\n<li>In addition to the added complications of speaking words this way, the effect of Words of Power still depends upon the medium and means of inscription, which is to say that air counts as the medium and material, for the purposes of determining the effect. Again, the effects are left up to conversation between GM and player.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Future Tense<br />\n<ul>\n<li>When working with triggered runes, it&rsquo;s up to the GM&rsquo;s preference as to whether the roll for Words of Power happens when the rune is scribed or when it&rsquo;s activated. However, describing the intended effect (and thus, whether the rune has a delayed trigger or not) always happens b efore the roll.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The Rest is Silence<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The new rune is likely in some way related to the deceased&rsquo;s powers and deeds in life.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Spells</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Doom<br />\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp;As written, this does nothing for GM characters and messes with the Barbarian&rsquo;s Herculean Appetites. For the first fix, the GM can interpret what fictional effect the spell might have that empowers a GM character against another character. For the Barbarian, if Herculean Appetites triggers, their player can choose to roll a third die, either a d6 or d8, but their final total must include a d6 and a d8.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Shibboleth<br />\n<ul>\n<li>This spell supersedes Tongue and Mouth of the Rune Keeper.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Celestial Bolt<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Found wanting by the Divine, that is.
