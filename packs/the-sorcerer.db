So sometimes you don&rsquo;t get it quite right and you demolish the emperor&rsquo;s orchard. Twice. Whatever. Or when the sacred crown you found just disappeared because you accidentally unraveled some of reality, you guess. Or you shot fireballs out of your eyes and everyone thought that was gross</p>\n<p>These are just some of the side effects people have got to learn to accept.

They don&rsquo;t describe how or what you do so much as color what happens when you do it, or the power through which you do it. The sets of actions are intended to be limiting but also a source of creativity. If one of your tags is e arthen, you could alter the Fighter&rsquo;s armor to be rocky and hard, or you could alter a stone wall to be porous to water. If one of your tags is  iendish, you could control a goblin with your devilish magic to fight for you or control a sea of hellfire to part.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Create a Spell<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The player and GM should be clear about the stakes and the intended effects of the spell before the roll. A spell description includes one tag, one action, and any number of metamagic praxes. The &ldquo;instead of&rdquo; clauses of Metamagic are meant to be instructive for this move. Without applying the &ldquo;targets&rdquo; praxis from Metamagic, any spell the Sorcerer creates runs the risk of affecting additional and unintended people, even before it spirals out of control, for example.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Metamagic<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Adding metamagic makes a spell more complicated, and so adds a stacking penalty to the roll.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Meltdown<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Many of these options have been left intentionally open to combine Dungeon World&rsquo;s narrative first approach with a wild-magic kind of randomness.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Push It<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The Sorcerer can push themselves multiple times in one roll - e.g., if they would like to work magic at the edge of their perception and have that magic last for one day, they could take both the Scarred and the Sick debilities to do so (as long as they had not already taken those debilities). Note that if Scarred is taken, the penalty to CHA will apply to the roll to Create a Spell.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Use Magic Item<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Cursed magic items being maximized might mean that the curse lingers for a long while, perhaps indefinitely. Otherwise, the maximization might still be dangerous, but is probably beneficial to the Sorcerer.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Catastrophe<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Automatically here means that if the Sorcerer ever has the maximum number of spikes, they cannot ask to have retroactively triggered Catastrophe or etc - as soon as the Sorcerer gets their last spike, they make the Meltdown move.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Magic Battery<br />\n<ul>\n<li>If The Sorcerer has somehow come into a move that requires a place of power, they can use themselves if they have this move.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A Mystery Wrapped in an Enigma<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The entity/GM character in question still chooses exactly what they want out of the Sorcerer&rsquo;s magical soul - the leverage is the soul, and however that might be interesting to the GM character is left to the GM to decide.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>","races":{"0":{"label":"Human","description":"When you Meltdown, you take +1 forward to your next move."},"1":{"label":"Genasi","description":"Your soul has been touched by unfiltered elemental magic.
