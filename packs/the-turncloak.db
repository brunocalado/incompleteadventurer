{"name":"The Turncloak","permission":{"default":0,"ZhC8ATjW2zJWoMct":3},"type":"class","data":{"name":"","description":"<h2>The Turncloak</h2>\n<p>They say the deepest level of hell is reserved for betrayers. By some accounts, it&rsquo;s a desolate, frozen wasteland, so cold and dark as to be entirely removed from even the thought of warmth. Its inhabitants are trapped there, perfectly still and utterly alone, forever.</p>\n<p>You don&rsquo;t lose a lot of sleep about it. It&rsquo;s hard enough being a traitor. Even the good guys want you dead. And besides, you&rsquo;ve got better things to do than worry about eternal damnation.</p>\n<p>For one, you&rsquo;re still in the process of enacting your great betrayal, the kind that gets written about in all caps. And two, one of these assholes keeps kicking mud on your bedroll, so that&rsquo;s gotta stop. Even sounds like someone might be planning to put a knife in your back.</p>\n<p>Honestly, you can think of worse fates. And hey, maybe you&rsquo;ll have some company in the afterlife after all.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Names</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Names: Sev, Theon, Deagol, Farash, Hara, Grima, Judas, Vesper, Breq, Abberkam, Zog, Hester</li>\n<li>Epithet: the Coward, the Rat, the Quisling, the Exile, the Moron, the Sick, the Liar, the Waste</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Look</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>EYES: Shifty, Bright, Angry, or _ ___________</li>\n<li>BODY: Strong, Hobbled, Average, or _ ___________</li>\n<li>CLOTHES: Cloaked, Armored, Tattered, or _ ___________</li>\n<li>MARK: Clipped ear, Branded arm, Facial scar, or _ ___________</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Bonds</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>I can tell _____________doesn&rsquo;t trust me.

The GM and player should discuss how many bonds the Turncloak can have at maximum, both with the enemy and with their allies. It is my official suggestion that at three bonds with the enemy, the Turncloak is in so deep as to be repulsive to essentially everyone.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Relevant Experience<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Just like when you take a starting move through a multiclass move, you get all the related moves/the moves that make that move work. The chosen move introduces complications&nbsp; can everyone who works for the enemy do this? Could only the Turncloak, making them especially visible and their return highly sought?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Underhanded<br />\n<ul>\n<li>One hand free means it can&rsquo;t be holding a shield, weapon, or anything else. The d irty tag refers to unfair, surprising tactics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Scoundrel Background<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Each Turncloak background imitates loosely some other moves that can be widely applicable. The Scoundrel&rsquo;s specifically is meant to accomplish something similar to the Thief&rsquo;s Trap Expert/Tools of the Trade, but the Turncloak will have to say what item they are sacrificing to disarm the trap. It&rsquo;s a little less proactive, but can work almost like a specific Defy Danger and can trigger whenever the Scoundrel activates a trap, even by accident.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Beastmaster<br />\n<ul>\n<li>In addition to the regular features of a monster (like its tags, damage, instincts, and moves) the beast should have a loyalty score if it ever needs to be ordered around. It feels thematically appropriate that even the beast could turn on the Turncloak, but if it&rsquo;s ever gone for good, the Turncloak should have the option of getting a new pet or exchanging this move.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Nemesis System<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Since Dungeon World doesn&rsquo;t have a Harm move like many other PbtA games, the Last Breath move can color just how bad it gets for the Turncloak, but having this move means that lasting death is probably off the table (think &ldquo;He&rsquo;s only mostly dead&rdquo; a la Princess Bride). If the Turncloak is felled by a foe but the other PCs remain, this move gives the Turncloak the power to decide if that foe escapes automatically. Lastly, &ldquo;your enemy&rdquo; is an expansive category - as long as the person that leaves the Turncloak for dead is aligned in some way with the Turncloak&rsquo;s enemy faction, this move could trigger.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Decisionist<br />\n<ul>\n<li>This wordy move represents the Turncloak making a meaningful turn one way or the other. On the one side is the new life they&rsquo;ve been making, represented by the bonds with their allies. On the other is the life they left behind, represented by the bonds with the enemy. This move triggers when the Turncloak finally picks, once and for all, even/especially symbolically which means more to them. The partial success (7-9) suggests that it isn&rsquo;t easy, or at least costs the Turncloak something. The full success means that the Turncloak might have left one life behind, but continues to carry that life experience, for now anyway.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","races":{"0":{"label":"Returned","description":"Your former masters brought you back from the dead.
