You don&rsquo;t have a secret. There&rsquo;s only the truth others are too afraid to admit.</p>\n<p>That anger is nothing more or less than a weapon.</p>\n<p>Like a sword, in your hands it can cut through flesh. Like a sword, sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to tell if you wield it or it wields you.</p>\n<p>That&rsquo;s okay. When you&rsquo;re knee deep in the steaming guts of a yugoloth horde, you don&rsquo;t need to know who&rsquo;s in control. Only that their obnoxious screams stoke the fires of your rage.</p>\n<p>Maybe it frightens the rest of them. You don&rsquo;t hear them complaining in the heat of battle. And hey, who&rsquo;d want to tell you to calm down?</p>\n<p>Nobody. Stay angry, berserker.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Name</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Human: Errp, Bruce, Ragnar, Odin, Syrese, Lancelot, Audie, Ajax, Layla, Logan, Lugh</li>\n<li>Orc: Grog, Korugar, Mugeg, Mek&rsquo;Daw, Ootonir, Ubi-me, Bugul, Temugh, Zurgo</li>\n<li>Dwarf: Durgin, Hroari, Barda, Throndar, Kadra, Hjolna, Tyrdrak, Jotu, Eirik, Maerth</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Look</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>BODY: Maimed, muscular, weathered, or _ ___________</li>\n<li>EYES: Lively, furious, sunken, or _ ___________</li>\n<li>HAIR: Bald, shaggy, braided, or _ ___________</li>\n<li>CLOTHES: Tattered l eathers, bloodstained furs, rusted armor pieces, _ ________</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Bonds</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>I can't keep ___________ out of danger forever, but I will try.</li>\n<li>______________ may be weak, but their potential i s astounding!</li>\n<li>I have seen the fire that l urks i n ________&rsquo;s heart - I will show them how to use i t.</li>\n<li>______________ needs to express their emotions or they&rsquo;re going to explode.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Gear</h2>\n<p>You start with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dungeon rations ( 5 uses, ration, 1 weight), Uses l eft: 5</li>\n<li>Healing potion ( 1 use, 0 weight)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Choose your arms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Brass Knuckles ( t ouch, precise, 1 weight)</li>\n<li>Battle Axe ( c lose, 1 weight)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Choose two:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ragged bow ( n ear, 1 weight) &amp; A mmo ( 3 ammo, 1 weight), Ammo l eft: 3</li>\n<li>Shield ( +1 armor, held, 1 weight)</li>\n<li>Adventuring gear, (5 uses, 1 weight), Uses left: 5</li>\n<li>11 coin ( 0 weight)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>About The Berserker</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Short Fuse\n<ul>\n<li>Ultimately, the trigger is up to the player, but the GM should confer about how to interpret the trigger - if pain is the trigger, does emotional pain count? Do paper cuts or splinters?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Orc Background<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The Orc background allows the Berserker a choice about whether they&rsquo;d like to enter a rage upon hitting 2 Fury. If they choose not to and then later hit 3 Fury, they enter a rage immediately.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ancestral Guardian<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The Guardian only appears while the Berserker is raging, and disappears (along with the bonus) after the rage ends.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Mindless Killing Machine<br />\n<ul>\n<li>An example of how this might work in play: A vampire has charmed the Berserker, and commands them to turn against their companions. The Berserker instead opts to attack some of the vampire&rsquo;s thralls nearby. After the thralls are slain, the vampire retreats, but not before giving the Berserker one last suggestion - destroy their enchanted weapon. There are no enemies left in sight, but the Berserker is still charmed; they have the option to accept the suggestion or attack something of the GM&rsquo;s choice.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Herald of the Storm<br />\n<ul>\n<li>The tag for damage &ldquo;type&rdquo; left entirely open. As usual, enemies with special resistances might resist this damage too - if the Berserker chooses bloody as their tag for this move, a blood elemental might not take any damage from this move. This move doesn&rsquo;t loop itself - dealing damage with this move doesn&rsquo;t cause you to deal additional damage with this move, and doesn&rsquo;t cause you to lose Fury like dealing damage usually does.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>","races":{"0":{"label":"Human","description":"When you first arrive i n a settlement, the GM will tell you what makes you angry about it."},"1":{"label":"Orc","description":"You may choose to enter your Rage when you reach 2 fury."},"2":{"label":"Dwarf","description":"When you w ield an improvised weapon of stone or\nmetal, it deals +2 damage when it breaks.
